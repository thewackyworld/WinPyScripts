# ℹ️ Overview
---
I just like all people love to throw a file on my desktop just to use it once and forget all about cleaning it. which is why inspired by arc deleting your tabs every day i decided to make this software that removes your dekstop files over to another folder of your choosing, while also sorting the type of file.

# 🚀 Usage

select which drive you want your dekstop files to be moved into, then select when you want it to run.

 If you want to create exception files that will will not be moved you will have to add it to the EXCEPTIONS in the config file (C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Local\AquariumCleaner)

>[EXCEPTIONS]
name = Desktop.ini, Codes
